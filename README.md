# Requirements 
As most things, if you do not meet theses requiremnts, just change the code to work for yourself.

## Services
You will need some things running on your server(s) for this code to just _work_

### JellyFin
You could use plex or anything similar, but you will need to make your own code for that API. 
This part could just be omitted, and it would just save to a folder.
### qBittorrent
This is so that we can start downloads that we need. You will also need a few plugins running in it, I would recomend 5 minimum.
### A way to Host a website
This could be Apache or Ngninx, just know that it needs to be able to run serverside PHP scripts. 
I am running mine through a CyberPannel ChildDomain
### Email Server
This could just be a gmail account, just make sure you have it all setup correctly.

## Code
The code is a mess, so good luck. It works for me. I hope if it is what you need that it helps.
If you need help, DM me. (:
